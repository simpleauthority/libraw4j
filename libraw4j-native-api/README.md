## libraw4j-native-api

This source tree is a **generated api** created by the [jextract](https://inside.java/2020/10/06/jextract/) tool.

It is subject to heavy change and at no notice. Do not depend directly on this API. Instead depend on libraw4j-core,
which depends on this API and provides a more stable  (and better to use) interface.
