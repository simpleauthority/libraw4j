## libraw4j <small>(1.0.0-SNAPSHOT)</small>
Java interface to the [libraw](https://www.libraw.org) library.

Used for reading data from raw images.

### libraw4j-core
The actual API to use, which presents a clean interface to the libraw library.

### libraw4j-native-api
The native API generated by [jextract](https://inside.java/2020/10/06/jextract/). It consists of Java source files
that are generated mirrors of the C header files. **libraw4j-core** uses this API. You probably should not. But, I'm
a README not the cops. Be aware it can and will change all the time without warning. However, **libraw4j-core** will 
follow semver.
